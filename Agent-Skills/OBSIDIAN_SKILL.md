This skill guides creation of interfaces for **The Obsidian Ritual**.
The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, or interface to build.

## 🧠 Design Thinking: The Alchemical Dualism

Every high-end experience must have a narrative arc. The Hero is built on **The Portal Concept**, divided into two unique scenes that react to the scroll video:

### 🎭 Scene I: THE HARVEST GENESIS (0% - 50% Scroll)
*   **Metaphor:** Observation of the raw origin.
*   **Visuals:** Ultra-thin strokes, "Submerged" typography (low opacity, high blur), cold bone-white tones.
*   **UI:** Diegetic HUD that acts as a sensory ledger (Altitude, Lot No, Process). It feels curated and exclusive.
*   **Tone:** "The secret of the bean is being revealed."

### 🌋 Scene II: THE LIQUID GOLD (50% - 100% Scroll)
*   **Metaphor:** The peak of extraction.
*   **Visuals:** Typography that "ignites" (Gold glows, sharp focus), high-contrast highlights.
*   **UI:** The HUD reflects peak aroma. Flavor notes appear, labels turn Gold.
*   **Tone:** "The ritual is complete. Awakening is achieved."

## 🎨 Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography Integration**: 
    - **Display**: `text-hero` (Cormorant Garamond). Use `italic` for Scene I and `bold/glow` for Scene II.
    - **Data**: `text-data` (Plus Jakarta/Urbanist). Scene I uses `muted`, Scene II uses `gold`.
- **Atmospheric Transitions**:
    - Use `mix-blend-mode: difference` or `overlay` to make text interact with the liquid sequence.
- **Motion Philosophy**:
    - **Scene I**: Floating, slow, "Suspended" movement.
    - **Scene II**: Snappy, weighted, "Gravitational" pulls toward the golden crema.

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns (Visuals to Avoid)
- **NO Tech/Military Details**: No coordinates, no "System Ready", no radars.
- **NO Generic Headlines**: Avoid marketing clichés. Use "Manifestos of the Grain".
- **NO Static Elements**: If the coffee is life, the UI must breathe.

**CRITICAL**: The user is not operating a machine; they are participating in an ancient ritual. Precision and mystery over technology.
